" Description: {{{
"   Plugin to provide quick access to a scratch buffer.  The :Scratch command
"   will open a temp buffer whose file type is the same as the file it was
"   invoked from, or you can optionally specify the file type you would like
"   by supplying it as an argument to the :Scratch command.  The contents of
"   the buffer will also be saved for you in files by filetype allowing you to
"   recall the last scratch contents for a particular file type using the
"   :ScratchPrevious command, which is available once you've opened a scratch
"   buffer (note: only one level of history is saved).
